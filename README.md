# AutomatedGradientWallpaperSystem CQ-23

* Generate 4K gradient coloured wallpapers
* Directly change the desktop wallpaper in a click

### How to use

_Project written in python 3.11, so I am assuming you have already python installed and is familiar with it. I will make the project more user-friendly at a later stage._

#### Step 1

Run the requirements.txt using the below command

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

---
#### Step 2

Run the python file named app.py using the below command

```python app.py```

---
#### Bonus Step

Right-click and edit the path inside the Windows Batch file named ```AutoGradientWallpaper.bat```

Here, first give the absolute path to your ```python.exe``` (if virtual environment is used then give the path to ```python.exe``` in virtual environment).

Then, give the absolute path to our ```app.py``` file.

That's it, now create a copy of the ```AutoGradientWallpaper.bat``` in to your desktop (home screen). Double-click and enjoy.
